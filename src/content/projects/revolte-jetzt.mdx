## Requirements

This was a solidarity development with the feminist radio project Revolte-Podcast. The aim was to create an online space where followers of the podcast could listen to it and access information about it.
It was therefore important to connect to the audio platforms used by the creators of this podcast. It was also important to create a button for donations.

## Responsabilities

I was responsible for the frontend development as well as the installation and setup of the whole WordPress system. I was also responsible for the domain and server management, DNS management, etc. I also had to do some design work. I also take care of the security of the project as well as the SEO.

## Tech

- It used **WordPress** for the frontend and as a Content Management System (CMS), using a free template [**Blocksy**](https://creativethemes.com/blocksy/), which give a lot of control, security and stability.
- **CSS3** to rich the very unique style required for the client.
- **PHP** to do some implementations were not possible directly with the template I used.
