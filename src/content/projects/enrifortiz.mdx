## Requirements

The website was developed according to the client's requirements, with the main emphasis on displaying the diﬀerent works. The Wordpress page was developed so that the client could easily maintain the website. A very basic logo was also created.

It was important to show the visual work in a good quality.

Due the characteristic of the project, I developed it using WordPress because give the possibility of build fast portfolio according the needs and possibilities of the artist, and also giving him the possiblitiy to mantaince the website by they own.

## Tech

- It used **WordPress** for the frontend and as a Content Management System (CMS), using a free template. For most of the customization I used [PageBuilder (SiteOrigin)](https://siteorigin.com/page-builder/). I also take care of the security of the project as well as the SEO.
- **CSS3** to rich the very unique style required for the client.
- **PHP** to do some implementations were not possible directly with the template I used.
