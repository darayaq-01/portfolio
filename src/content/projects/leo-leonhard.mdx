## Features

- JavaScript
- Gatsby

- Portfolio
- Carrousel
- Content Managment System
- CI/CD

## Requirements

The site was already up and running. I had to implement some features like a new carousel, connection to the database, solve some problems with the content management system and improve the performance.

## Responsabilities

I did maintance to the code as well as solve some problems as for example when due to some previous problems all the information of the database was lost. Implemented the new carousel and set up the new content management system with Contentful.

## Tech

- The website has already been developed using **Gatsby** in the frontend.
- The website code is hosted in **Github**.
- The website is served from **Netlify** cloud.
- The content management system used is **Contentful**.
- For styling is used mainly pure **CSS**, but also **React Bootstrap**.
