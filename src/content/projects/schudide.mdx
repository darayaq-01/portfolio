## Requirements

It was necessary to create the main logo of the SchuDiDe project, as well as this logo it should be useful and integrated to be used for all the sub-projects.
It was also necessary to fix some problems with the book cover and to create a new book cover using a GIF design.

## Responsabilities

I designed the new logos and prepared the covers for two books based on the work of a designer.
The new logo was created with the idea that it represents the ripples created when a stone falls into water. This symbolises the expansion of knowledge and understanding, two relevant aspects of the SchuDiDe project. The waves were also used to intersperse the different corporate colours of the different sub-projects.
Regarding the work on the book covers, the design of one of them had to be prepared for printing, based on the work previously developed by an artist. The other cover was created using a GIF from the artist.

## Tech

In all cases, the work was done using InkScape as the vector tool and Gimp to edit some of the images.
