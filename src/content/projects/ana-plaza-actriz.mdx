## Features

- Portfolio
- Blog

## Requirements

The aim was to create a website that documents the different dimensions of the client as an actress. So the website presents different sections for different media, photography, video, blog, press archive, etc.
It was necessary to have something simple and maintainable by the client as much as possible, for this reason the option was WordPress, using a free template but with a trustworthy and secure support.

## Responsabilities

I developed the frontend and aswell I prepared the backend to be all set up for the client to take care of the site by their own. I was also responsible for setting up the server and hosting. I also take care to prepare a good SEO setup.

## Tech

- **WordPress** was used for the front end and as a content management system (CMS), using a free template. Most of the customisation was done using [PageBuilder (SiteOrigin)](https://siteorigin.com/page-builder/).
- **CSS3** to create the very unique style required for the client.
- **PHP** to do some implementations that were not possible directly with the template I used.sed.
