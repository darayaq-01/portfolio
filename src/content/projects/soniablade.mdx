## Requirements

Developed to support the work of the client as freelance photographer. So, the website was thought under a minimalist framework where the images occupy all the space.

## Responsabilities

The website was developed in Wordpress, so the client could maintain the website herself. The best options for optimal image quality and image protection were considered. A very simple logo was also created.

## Tech

- It used **WordPress** for the frontend and as a Content Management System (CMS), using a free template. I take care of the presentation of pictures using Parallax. I also take care of the security of the project as well as the SEO.
- **CSS3** to rich the very unique style required for the client.
- **PHP** to do some implementations were not possible directly with the template I used.
