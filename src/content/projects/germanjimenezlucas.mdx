## Requirements

Website developed for a furniture restoration shop. Basically, the client wanted a web page that would highlight the work done, the images of the furniture and the process from the moment it is restored until it is ﬁnished.

## Responsabilities

The website and logo were developed for this client. The logo was created from a base provided by the client. The website was built with Wordpress, with a special emphasis on the space for photography, to allow you to see the restoration process.

## Tech

- It used **WordPress** for the frontend and as a Content Management System (CMS), using a free template. For most of the customization I used [PageBuilder (SiteOrigin)](https://siteorigin.com/page-builder/). I also take care of the security of the project as well as the SEO.
- **CSS3** to rich the very unique style required for the client.
- **PHP** to do some implementations were not possible directly with the template I used.
